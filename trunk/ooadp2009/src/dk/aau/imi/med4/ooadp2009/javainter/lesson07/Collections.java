		 * The java.util.Collection interface defines a container that the user

		 * determine the number of items in a Collection and create an array
		 * that contains all the elements in the collection.
		 * 
		 * The Collection interface's add() method is used to add new items to a
		 * collection.
		 * 
		 * The Collection interface's remove() method is used to remove items
		 * from a collection.
		 * 
		 * The Collection interface's size is determined using the size()
		 * method.
		 * 
		 * The elements in a Collection can all be put into an array using the
		 * toArray() method.

		 * Because the Collection interface is an interface, it cannot be
		 * instantiated. So to demonstrate the use of its methods, we have to
		 * create an instance of a class that implements the Collection
		 * interface. A commonly used example of such a class is the ArrayList
		 * class which is the Java Collection's answer to a normal array. An
		 * ArrayList is cheap to create and fast for random access. It is
		 * expensive to add or remove items from the beginning of a large
		 * ArrayList, but, on average, adding and remove elements to an
		 * ArrayList is fast.

		 * Points are equal if and only if their co-ordinate values are equal.

		 * Sometimes we want a collection to be a set of objects, rather than

		 * 
		 * In the Java Collections framework, we have an interface called Set
		 * which defines the behaviour of a set. A commonly-used implementation
		 * of the Set interface is HashSet.
		 * 
		 * Adding elements to and removing elements from a HashSet is very fast.
		 * It is also very fast (constant time) to check whether a HashSet
		 * contains an item.
		 * 
		 * However, you cannot guarantee that the elements in a HashSet are in
		 * any particular order. This is different from the ArrayList where we
		 * know that the order of the elements is the order that we put them in
		 * the list.
		 * 
		 * The HashSet decides whether two elements are "equal" or not using the
		 * hashCode() method which should be overridden in the definition of the
		 * element class.

		/*
		 * If you want a set in which all the elements are in a guaranteed

		 * equals() method to determine if two elements are equal (and refuses
		 * to add a second element if it is equal to one that is already in the
		 * set).
		 * 
		 * To store an object in a TreeSet, it must implement the Comparable<E>
		 * interface. This means that you have to define a compareTo() method in
		 * the class definition of the element class. This has been done in the
		 * Point class.

		 * are in lexicographical order. Let's use an enhanced for loop for this
